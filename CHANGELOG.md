# Changelog for Elixir v1.17

This release includes type inference of patterns to provide warnings for an initial set of constructs (binaries, maps, and atoms) within the same function. It also includes a new Duration data type to interact with Calendar types, support for Erlang/OTP 27, and many other improvements.

## Warnings from gradual set-theoretic types

This release introduces gradual set-theoretic types to infer types from patterns and use them to type check programs, enabling the Elixir compiler to find faults and bugs in codebases without requiring changes to existing software. The underlying principles, theory, and roadmap of our work have been outlined in ["The Design Principles of the Elixir Type System" by Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, Jos√© Valim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391).

At the moment, Elixir developers will interact with set-theoretic types only through warnings found by the type system. The current implementation models all data types in the language:

  * `binary()`, `integer()`, `float()`, `pid()`, `port()`, `reference()` - these types are indivisible. This means both `1` and `13` get the same `integer()` type.

  * `atom()` - it represents all atoms and it is divisible. For instance, the atom `:foo` and `:hello_world` are also valid (distinct) types.

  * `map()` and structs - maps can be "closed" or "open". Closed maps only allow the specified keys, such as `%{key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Open maps support any other keys in addition to the ones listed and their definition starts with `...`, such as `%{..., key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Structs are closed maps with the `__struct__` key.

  * `tuple()`, `list()`, and `function()` - currently they are modelled as indivisible types. The next Elixir versions will also introduce fine-grained support to them.

We focused on atoms and maps on this initial release as they are respectively the simplest and the most complex types representations, so we can stress the performance of the type system and quality of error messages. Modelling these types will also provide the most immediate benefits to Elixir developers. Assuming there is a variable named `user`, holding a `%User{}` struct with an `address` field, Elixir v1.17 will emit the following warnings at compile-time:

  * Pattern matching against a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `%{adress: ...} = user` (notice `address` vs `adress`)

  * Accessing a key on a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `user.adress`

  * Updating a struct or a map that does not define the given key, such as `%{user | adress: ...}`

  * Invoking a function on non-modules, such as `user.address()`

  * Capturing a function on non-modules, such as `&user.address/0`

  * Attempting to invoke to call an anonymous function without an actual function, such as `user.()`

  * Performing structural comparisons with structs, such as `my_date < ~D[2010-04-17]`

  * Performing structural comparisons between non-overlapping types, such as `integer >= string`

  * Building and pattern matching on binaries without the relevant specifiers, such as `<<name>>` (this warns because by default it expects an integer, it should have been `<<name::binary>>` instead)

  * Attempting to rescue an undefined exception or a struct that is not an exception

  * Accessing a field that is not defined in a rescued exception

These new warnings help Elixir developers find bugs earlier and give more confidence when refactoring code, especially around maps and structs. While some of these warnings were emitted in the past, they were discovered using syntax analysis. The new warnings are more reliable, precise, and with better error messages. Keep in mind, however, that the Elixir typechecker only infers types from patterns within the same function at the moment. Analysis from guards and across function boundaries will be added in future relases. For more details, see our new [reference document on gradual set-theoretic types](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html).

The type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) and [Remote](https://remote.com/). The development work is currently sponsored by [Fresha](https://www.fresha.com/), [Starfish*](https://starfish.team/), and [Dashbit](https://dashbit.co/).

## Erlang/OTP support

This release adds support for Erlang/OTP 27 and drops support for Erlang/OTP 24. We recommend Elixir developers to migrate to Erlang/OTP 26 or later, especially on Windows. Support for WERL (a graphical user interface for the Erlang terminal on Windows) will be removed in Elixir v1.18.

## Adding `Duration` and `shift/2` functions

Elixir introduces the `Duration` data type and APIs to shift dates, times, and date times by a given duration, considering different calendars and time zones.

```elixir
iex> Date.shift(~D[2016-01-31], month: 2)
~D[2016-03-31]
```

Note the operation is called `shift` (instead of `add`) since working with durations does not obey properties such as associativity. For instance, adding one month and then one month does not give the same result as adding two months:

```elixir
iex> ~D[2016-01-31] |> Date.shift(month: 1) |> Date.shift(month: 1)
~D[2016-03-29]
```

Still, durations are essential for building intervals, recurring events, and modelling scheduling complexities found in the world around us. For `DateTime`s, Elixir will correctly deal with time zone changes (such as Daylight Saving Time), but provisions are also available in case you want to surface conflicts (for example, you shifted to a wall clock that does not exist, because the clock has been moved forward by one hour). See `DateTime.shift/2` for examples.

Finally, a new `Kernel.to_timeout/1` function has been added, which helps developers normalize durations and integers to a timeout used by Process APIs. For example, to send a message after one hour, one can now write:

```elixir
Process.send_after(pid, :wake_up, to_timeout(hour: 1))
```
